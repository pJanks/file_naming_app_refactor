# File Naming App

This app can be used to select one or more files from a file explorer or drag and drop one or multiple files, and prepend them with a descriptor. It will also create a folder to store the groups in. **This utility will NOT edit the original files**. I advise checking to make sure the prepended files are not corrupted before erasing original files. After filling out the form and selecting the files, simply click Submit. Go to the uploads directory created at the root of this project and verify that all of your files are there and that they are not corrupted. Node.js must be installed to run this app.
